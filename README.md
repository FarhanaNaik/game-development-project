# Project Title

Minesweeper is a puzzle game generally played on personal computers. The game features a grid of clickable squares, with hidden "mines" scattered throughout the board. 
The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

Rules:-

   Minesweeper rules are very simple. The board is divided into cells, with mines randomly distributed. To win, you need to open all the cells. The number on a cell shows
   the number of mines adjacent to it. Using this information, you can determine cells that are safe, and cells that contain mines. Cells suspected of being mines can be 
   marked with a character(p) using the right mouse button.
